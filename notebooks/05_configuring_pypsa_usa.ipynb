    "\n",
    "To create a multi-horizon network, specify multiple years in `planning_horizons` and choose a `foresight` option:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "scenario:\n",
    "  planning_horizons: [2030, 2040, 2050]  # Multiple planning horizons\n",
    "  # ... other scenario settings\n",
    "\n",
    "foresight: 'perfect'  # or 'myopic'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Foresight Options\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`perfect`**: Creates a monolithic optimization model where all planning horizons are optimized simultaneously. Future horizon values of costs and demand are incorporated into decisions made in earlier planning horizons.\n",
    "- **`myopic`**: Solves each planning horizon sequentially, passing results forward to subsequent periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Multi-Horizon Configuration\n",

    "#### Important: Planning Horizon Alignment\n",
    "\n",
    "**The demand profile choice must match your planning horizons:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For `profile: eia`**: Planning horizons must be within **2018-2023**\n",

    "- **`county`**: County-level resolution\n",
    "- **`reeds_zone`**: ReEDS zone resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Filtering Regions\n",
